/*
 * This file is more like a "read me" file than anything, but it is used
 * to gather all the view and controller classes into one to be provided
 * to the AppRunner.
 * 
 * What's visible to the user as the GUI is drawn in the DrawnView file.
 * This template is best used for programs that has only one single window.
 * If you want to create more windows or changable panels, you'll need to 
 * understand proper MVC design better.
 * 
 * The view classes send messages to model classes to get information
 * to display to the user on the screen.  Methods for displaying that data
 * are written in the ViewOutputs class.
 * 
 * The controller classes (like the ViewUserActions class) provides actions
 * that the user can trigger through the view classes.  Those user actions are 
 * written in the ViewUserActions class, and are wired into GUI elements there
 * as well.
 * 
 * Students are expected to modify DrawnView (by drawing the GUI there), and
 * the ViewOutputs and ViewUserActions classes.  Do NOT modify this 
 * CompleteViewController class file though.

/*
 * WARNING: There is nothing in this file for students to edit or change.
 *          This file is intended to have no student-serviceable code.
